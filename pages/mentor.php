<h1>Mentoring</h1>
<p>
Interested in learning how to play or get better at League of Legends? This is the 

place for you.

The mentor page was created to give League of Legends players an easy way to 

access the knowledge and training from existing experienced players within the 

club. By using this page you can contact our head mentor and arrange for time to 

meet up or play together. The mentor page is not only for intermediate and novice 

players, but also for beginners, who can get a solid platform through our mentor 

program. This program is in the beginning stages but will soon feature multiple

mentors for teaching. Please contact our head mentor, Robin Lee, to get started as 

soon as possible. </p>
